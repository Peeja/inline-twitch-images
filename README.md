# The amazing Twitch chat image inliner

A dead simple Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script to inline images linked from
Twitch chat. Based on [Paul Saunders'
script](https://github.com/paul-lrr/nifty-chat-monitor), but this one works on
the sidebar chat rather than the dedicated chat page, and doesn't do anything
but inline images.

Also, similar to [Twimages](https://github.com/SammyIAm/Twimages), which appears
to be out of date and no longer works for me.
